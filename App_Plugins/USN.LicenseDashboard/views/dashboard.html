                <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> If your website is hit via an invalid domain the invalid license message will appear on your website and will remain until your website is restarted and then hit via a valid domain. Please refer to the installation
                guide available via your uSkinned Members Area when choosing the option to download your theme. In this guide you will find instructions on setting up domain redirects correctly so that your website can only be served via a single domain.
